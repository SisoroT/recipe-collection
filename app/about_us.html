                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Ryan Taylor and I am senior computer science
                        major at Georgia State University. I also happen to be a
                        passionate home cook part-time, so I created the Online
                        Recipe Collection.

                    <h2>Project Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        Online Recipe Collection is a platform for users to
                        explore and save recipes from around the World. This
                        website was developed as a class project, and I chose
                        this project because I wanted to make it easier for
                        people to find new recipes.

                    <h2>Technology Used</h2>
                    <p>
                        This website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its
                        front-end, and PHP with phpMyAdmin for its back-end. The
                        website is responsive and mobile-friendly, providing a
                        seamless experience for users across different devices.
                        AJAX was implemented to provide real-time updates to the
                        content without the need to refresh the page.

                    <h2>What I Learned in This Class</h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout this class, I have learned valuable skills in
                        web development, including responsive design, database
                        management, and user authentication. This project has
                        allowed me to practice using different web technologies,
                        expanding my knowledge and solidifying my understanding
                        of web development.
